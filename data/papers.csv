0,"Modern live loudspeaker systems consist of broadband sources, often using variable curvature line sources, combined with subwoofers. While it is common practice to fly the broadband sources to improve energy distribution in the audience, most subwoofer configurations remain ground-stacked because of practical constraints and alleged efficiency loss of flown configurations. This article aims at evaluating the efficiency of flown subwoofers for large audiences as compared to their ground-stacked counterparts. We use finite element simulations to determine the influence of several factors: baffling effect, trim height. We show that flown configurations remain efficient at the back of the venue while reducing the SPL excess at the front of the audience.","['L-Acoustics, Marcoussis, France']","['Corteel, Etienne', ' Coste Dombre, Hugo', ' Combet, Christophe', ' Horyn, Yoachim', ' Montignies, François']",Talk,Transducers,On the Efficiency of Flown vs. Ground Stacked Subwoofer Configurations
1,"Within the scope of the literature surrounding the Loudness War, the “louder is better” paradigm plays a cornerstone role in the motivation and also presumed justification for the continued use of hyper-compression. At the core of this assumption is the non-linearity of frequency response of the human auditory system first identified by Fletcher and Munson [11]. Previous research into listener preferences concerning hyper-compression has attempted to rationalize this production practice with audience expectations. The stimuli used in these studies have invariably been loudness normalized to remove loudness bias in audition so that only the perceptual cues of dynamic range compression (DRC) are under examination. The results of these studies have proven less than conclusive and varied. The research study presented herein examines the extent of influence the “louder is better” paradigm has on listener preferences via a direct comparison between listener preference tasks that present music that is loudness normalized and music that retains the level differentiation which is a by-product of the hyper-compression process. It was found that a level differential of 10 dB had a significant influence of listener preferences as opposed to the arguably weak perceptual cues of DRC.","['University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia']","['Taylor, Robert W.']",Talk,Perception,"Hyper-Compression in Music Production: Testing the ""Louder Is Better"" Paradigm"
2,"Binaural based machine learning applications generally require a large number of HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) measurements. However, building an HRTF database from measurements of a large number of participants can be a time-consuming and tedious process. An alternative method is to combine the data from different existing databases to create a large training dataset. This is a significant challenge due to the large difference in measurement angles, filter size, normalization schemes, and sample rates inherent in different databases. Consequently, training of some machine learning algorithms can be cumbersome, requiring significant trial and error with different data and settings. To facilitate convenient preparation of datasets, this paper presents a Matlab-based tool that allows researchers to prepare and consolidate various HRTF datasets across different databases in a robust and fast manner.

3,"Magnitude-oriented approaches dominate the voice analysis front-ends of most current technologies addressing, e.g., speaker identification, speech coding/compression, and voice reconstruction and re-synthesis. A popular technique is all-pole vocal tract modeling. The phase response of all-pole models is known to be non-linear and highly dependent on the magnitude frequency response. In this paper we use a shift-invariant phase-related feature that is estimated from signal harmonics in order to study the impact of all-pole models on the phase structure of voiced sounds. We relate that impact to the phase structure that is found in natural voiced sounds to conclude on the physiological validity of the group delay of all-pole vocal tract modeling. Our findings emphasize that harmonic phase models are idiosyncratic, and this is important in speaker identification and in fostering the quality and naturalness of synthetic and reconstructed speech.","['University of Porto, Porto, Portugal']","['Ferreira, Aníbal']",Talk,Signal Processing,On the Physiological Validity of the Group Delay Response of All-Pole Vocal Tract Modeling

5,"When instrumentalists perform with vibrato, they add a quasi-periodic frequency modulation to the note. Although this modulation is rarely purely sinusoidal, many methods for vibrato parameterization focus exclusively on the rate and depth of the frequency modulation, with less attention given to measuring how a performer’s vibrato changes over the course of a note. In this paper we interpret the vibrato trajectories as instantiations of a random process that can be characterized by an associated autocorrelation function and power spectral density. From these distributions, a coherence time can be estimated that describes the stability of the vibrato within a note. This metric can be used to characterize individual performers as well as for resynthesizing vibratos of different styles.","['University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA']","['Smith, Sarah R.', ' Bocko, Mark F.']",Talk,Acoustics and Signal Processing,A Statistical Metric for Stability in Instrumental Vibrato

With the measured mobility matrix from the actuators to the measurement points, the optimal filter for each actuator is obtained based on the solutions of the maximization problem. The proposed method does not need to estimate both the natural frequencies and the modal shapes and therefore is easy to be implemented.

7,"We propose two new methods to classify guitar strings for automated tablature transcription using only monophonic audio. The first method estimates the linear regression of log-inharmonicities of guitar strings with respect to their pitches and assigns unseen notes to the strings whose means and variances maximize the probability of their measured inharmonicities. The second method, developed as a baseline, characterizes the inharmonicity distribution of each fretboard position as a normal probability density, and then similarly assigns unseen notes to the fretboard positions that maximize the likelihood of their observed inharmonicities. Results from the standard Real World Corpus of guitar recordings show that exploiting regressions generally improves accuracy compared to our baseline, while both achieve adequate performance in guitar-independent test scenarios.","['Electro-Harmonix / New Sensor Corporation, Brooklyn, NY, USA', ' Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA(See document for exact affiliation information.)']","['Michelson, Jonathan', ' Stern, Richard', ' Sullivan, Thomas']",Talk,Applications in Audio,Automatic Guitar Tablature Transcription from Audio Using Inharmonicity Regression and Bayesian Classification

9,"In order to simulate the Ondes Martenot, a classic electronic musical instrument, we aim to model its circuit using Port-Hamiltonian Systems (PHS). PHS have proven to be a powerful formalism to provide models of analog electronic circuits for audio applications, as they guarantee the stability of simulations, even in the case of non-linear systems. However, some systems cannot be converted directly into PHS because their architecture cause what are called realizability conflicts. The Ondes Martenot circuit is one of those systems. In this paper a method is introduced to resolve such conflicts automatically: problematic components are replaced by equivalent components without altering the overall structure nor the content of the modeled physical system.","['IRCAM, Paris, France', ' CNRS-Musé de la Musique, Paris, France(See document for exact affiliation information.)']","['Najnudel, Judy', ' Hélie, Thomas', ' Boutin, Henri', ' Roze, David', ' Maniguet, Thierry', ' Vaiedelich, Stéphane']",Talk,Signal Processing,Analog Circuits and Port-Hamiltonian Realizability Issues: A Resolution Method for Simulations via Equivalent Components
10,"Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are typically measured with loudspeakers facing the listener. Therefore, it is assumed that loudspeaker directivity to the left and the right ear is equal. However, in practice the directivity to both ears may not be equal. For instance, differences can be caused by changes to a listener’s location or uncommon loudspeaker driver orientations. This paper discusses the effect of binaural difference in directivity of loudspeaker on spatial audio processing and proposes an efficient solution that improves the spatial effect by compensating the directivity difference.

14,"Spatial microphones are used to acquire sound scenes, while spot microphones are commonly used to acquire individual sound sources with high quality. These recordings are essential when producing spatial audio upmixes. However, to automatically create upmixes, or to assist audio engineers in creating these, information about the position of the sources in the scene is also required. We propose a supervised sound source localization method to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of several simultaneously active sound sources in reverberant and noisy environments that utilizes several spot microphones and a single spatial microphone. The proposed method employs system identification techniques to estimate the relative impulse responses between each spot microphone and the spatial microphone from which the DOAs can be extracted.","['International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany']","['Ibáñez Calvo, Miguel', ' Luis Valero, Maria', ' Habets, Emanuël A.

The assumptions behind the extended model and its ability to predict the frequency response of interference tubes are validated through simulations and by fitting the model parameters to frequency response measurements of a tube with varying conductance per unit length, using two different mountings. Results suggest that a tube with varying conductance per unit length is most effective at attenuating the off-axis sound if the conductance per unit length is decreased towards the tail end of the tube.","['Aalborg University, Copenhagen, Denmark', ' Technical University of Denmark, Kgs.

Commonly used downmix methods are based on fixed downmix coefficients or mixing equations.

In this paper a novel method is introduced that addresses these problems. The method aims to preserve the energy of the input signals during the downmix. In doing so, magnitude and phase are retrieved from two different approaches and combined afterwards. A listening test was conducted.

28,"Binaural rendering is a technology for spatialized sound that can be advantageously coupled with the visual of a mobile phone. By rendering the auditory scene out of the screen, all around the user, it is a potentially powerful tool of immersion. However, this audio-visual association may lead to specific perception artifacts. One of them is the ventriloquist effect, i.e., the perception of a sound and an image as they come from the same location, while they are actually at different places. We investigate the conditions of this effect to occur using an experimental method called Point of Subjective Spatial Alignment (PSSA). Given the position of a visual stimulus, we determine the integration window, i.e., the range of locations in the horizontal plane where auditory stimulus is perceived as matching the visual stimulus location. Several parameters are varied: semantic type of the stimuli (neutral or meaningful) and sound elevation (same elevation as the visual or above subject’s head). Results reveal the existence of an integration window in all cases. But, surprisingly, the sound is attracted by the visual as located in the virtual scene, rather than its real location on screen. We interpret it as a mark of immersion. Besides, we observe that integration window is not altered by elevation, provided that stimuli are semantically meaningful.","['CNAM (CEDRIC), Paris, France', ' Orange Labs, Lannion, France', ' IRCAM - CNRS, Paris, France(See document for exact affiliation information.)']","['Moreira, Julian', ' Gros, Laetitia', ' Nicol, Rozenn', ' Viaud-Delmon, Isabelle']",Talk,Spatial Audio,Spatial Auditory-Visual Integration: The Case of Binaural Sound on a Smartphone

Seventy measurements were used to formulate frequency response curves for each loudspeaker characterizing the effects of listener position and in-room reflections. A model developed by Olive [1] was applied to the response curves to predict a preference rating for each loudspeaker. A commercial flat-panel speaker and a flat-panel speaker with a modal crossover network enabled/disabled were measured along with a conventional speaker. The modal crossover speaker scored over 10 points higher than the other flat-panel speakers and displayed a smooth low-frequency response.

62,"This paper examines what happens when a digital audio signal is measured with respect to a digital reference signal that was created based on a different clock. The resultant change in frequency and time depends on the degree of mismatch between clocks and may introduce a significant amount of distortion into the measurements. But the distortion is different from the types normally considered important in audio systems and may obscure other types of distortion, e.g., harmonic, IMD, and noise, that are more important to accurately assess. A difference in clocking essentially creates a difference in sample rates. Therefore, sample rate conversion methods can be used to mitigate the discrepancy. Although this approach is effective, it cannot be used when the sample rate difference is too small, it can be computationally intensive, and it cannot entirely eliminate the effects of a clocking difference.

By using orthogonal randomization matrices, computational complexity can be minimized by separating the Wiener ?lter from the inverse randomization. Our evaluation shows that Wiener filtering in combination with a randomized distributed codec is an efficient method to attenuate background and quantization noise at the decoder.","['International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany', ' Aalto University, Espoo, Finland(See document for exact affiliation information.)']","['Fischer, Johannes', ' Bäckström, Tom']",Poster,Applications in Audio,Noise Reduction for Randomized Speech and Audio Coding in WASNs

The filters for the secondary loudspeakers are the result of an optimization problem that minimizes the total sound pressure level of both primary and secondary loudspeakers in a sensitive area and the impact of the secondary loudspeakers on the audience area of the concert. We report results from three different experiments with increasing complexity and scale. The sound field control system was reducing the sound pressure level in the dark zone on average by 10 dB below 1 kHz in a small scale experiment in anechoic conditions, by up to 14 dB in a controlled large scale open-air experiment and by up to 6 dB at a pilot test at a music festival.","['Technical University of Denmark, Kgs.

117,"Flat-Panel Loudspeakers are most effective at reproducing audio non-directionally when operating at frequencies with many overlapping modes. Frequency regions with low modal overlap produce directional acoustic radiation, long decay times, as well as sharp peaks and notches in pressure. Exciter arrays re-enable use of these frequency regions by restricting structural excitation to a single mode until the frequency region of high modal overlap. An optimization method is described here for determining the placement of exciters such that they are all driven by a single amplifier yet only excite a single structural mode. Experimental results are reported for an acrylic panel with 4, 8, and 11 exciters that demonstrate successful operation of the exciter arrangements.","['University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA']","['Anderson, David', ' Heilemann, Michael', ' Bocko, Mark F.']",Talk,Applications in Audio,"Optimal Exciter Array Placement for Flat-Panel Loudspeakers Based on a Single-Mode, Parallel-Drive Layout"
118,"Head-related transfer functions (HRTF) are used for creating the perception of a virtual sound source at an arbitrary azimuth-elevation. Publicly available databases use a subset of these directions due to physical constraints (viz., loudspeakers for generating the stimuli not being point-sources) and the time required to acquire and deconvolve responses for a large number of spatial directions. In this paper we present a subspace-based technique for reconstructing HRTFs at arbitrary directions for the IRCAM-Listen HRTF database, which comprises a set of HRTFs sampled every 15 deg along the azimuth direction. The presented technique includes first augmenting the sparse IRCAM dataset using the concept of auditory localization blur, then deriving a set of P=6 principal components, using PCA for the original and augmented HRTFs, and then training a neural network (ANN) with these directional principal components. The reconstruction of HRTF corresponding to an arbitrary direction is achieved by post-multiplying the ANN output, comprising the estimated six principal components, with a frequency weighting matrix. The advantage of using a subspace approach, involving only 6 principal components, is to obtain a low complexity HRTF synthesis ANN-based model as compared to training an ANN model to output an HRTF over all frequencies. Objective results demonstrate a reasonable interpolation with the presented approach.","['HP Labs., Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA', ' HP, Inc., Vancouver, WA, USA(See document for exact affiliation information.)']","['Bharitkar, Sunil G.', ' Mauer, Timothy', ' Wells, Teresa', ' Berfanger, David']",Talk,Spatial Audio,Subspace-Based HRTF Synthesis from Sparse Data: A Joint PCA and ML-Based Approach

A prevailing challenge is to properly control the sound source, as loudspeakers have a tendency to vary their performance due to many influences. The acoustic environment for the test must provide reproducible conditions and is ideally anechoic. Noise from outside must be damped across the measurement bandwidth, so that it doesn’t affect the results. Different testing requirements for various types of microphones are shown.

121,"Envelopment – the perception of being surrounded by a beautiful acoustic space – is one of the joys of concert halls and great recordings. Recording engineers strive to capture reverberation independently in each channel, and reverberation from digital equipment is similarly non-coherent. But in playback rooms with a single low frequency driver or a single subwoofer reverberation is often flat, frontal, and without motion. In this paper we will show that full range loudspeakers or at least two independent subwoofers can bring low frequency envelopment back to a playback room. In some rooms minimizing room modes with high pressure at the listening position while maximizing lateral modes with minima near the listeners can help. If necessary, we put two independent subwoofers at the sides of the listeners.","['David Griesinger Acoustics, Cambridge, MA, USA']","['Griesinger, David']",Talk,Perception,Reproducing Low Frequency Spaciousness and Envelopment in Listening Rooms

123,"The reproduction of binaural audio through loudspeakers, also commonly referred to as Transaural audio, allows for the rendering of immersive virtual acoustic images when the original binaural signal is accurately delivered to the listener’s ears. Such accurate reproduction is generally achieved by using a network of cross-talk-cancellation filters designed for a given listener’s position and orientation. This work studies the effect of small rotational movements of the listener’s head on the perceived location of a virtual sound source when the binaural signal is reproduced using an array of loudspeakers.

Creating acoustic models that accurately mimic these changes is problematic, showing significant variance between audience implementation methods and modelling techniques. Changes in total absorption per person due to audience size and density makes absorption coefficients selection difficult. In this research, FDTD simulations confirm that for densely packed audiences, diffraction leads to a linear correlation between capacity and total absorption at low frequencies, while at high frequencies there is less increase in total absorption per person. The significance of diffraction renders ray-tracing inaccurate for individually modelled audience members and has further implications regarding accuracy of standard audience modelling procedures.","['University of Derby, Derby, Derbyshire, UK', ' Peter Mapp Associates, Colchester, UK(See document for exact affiliation information.)']","['Hammond, Ross', ' Hill, Adam J.', ' Mapp, Peter']",Talk,Acoustics and Signal Processing,On the Accuracy of Audience Implementations in Acoustic Computer Modelling
